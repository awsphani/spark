HDFS – Hadoop Distributed file system

Command line hadoop fs or hdfs dfs

Properties files
/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml
/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml
Important Properties
fs.defaultFS
dfs.blocksize
dfs.replication

HDFS commands
Copying Files
From local file system(hadoop fs -copyFromLocal or -put)
To local file system (hadoop fs -copyToLocal or -get)
From one HDFS location to other (hadoop fs -cp)
Listing files (hadoop fs -ls)
Previewing data from files (hadoop fs -tail or -cat)
Checking sizes of all files (hadoop fs -du).

Properties Files
From gateway node, we can go to the location /etc/hadoop/conf
Here we can see properties files which control the environment of HDFS, YARN etc

We have a bunch of files in this location but our primary focus is on only two files 
core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml

In core-site.xml we can see the information about our cluster

In hdfs-site.xml we can see the important properties file such as block size and replication

Copy Files From Local Machine to HDFS
To copy files from local machine to HDFS use below command
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /data/crime /user/username/.


YARN Quick Preview

In certifications Spark typically runs in YARN mode
We should be able to check the memory configuration to understand the cluster capacity
/etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-site.xml
/etc/hadoop/conf/spark-env.sh
Spark default settings
Number of executors – 2
Memory – 1 GB
Quite often we underutilize resources. Understanding memory settings thoroughly and then mapping them with data size we are trying to process we can accelerate the execution of jobs.
